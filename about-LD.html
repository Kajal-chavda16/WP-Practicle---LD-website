            <h2>Foundation</h2>

            <div class="first">
                <p>
                    L.D. College of Engineering (LDCE) was established on 20th June, 1948 as one of the first few
                    engineering colleges in India. The institution owes its foundation to the bold and inspired vision
                    of Kasturbhai Lalbhai, who named the college after his father, Lalbhai Dalpatbhai.

                    Initially affiliated to Bombay University, L.D. College of Engineering (LDCE) came under the Gujarat
                    University after its establishment in 1949.

                    The land for the campus was donated by the Lalbhai family, who played a major role in decisions
                    pertaining to this institute in its initial years. LDCE started its journey by offering three
                    undergraduate courses in Mechanical, Civil and Electrical Engineering with an intake of 35 students
                    in each field.
